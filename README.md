## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load the IPL Dataset**
3. **Initial Data Exploration**

   * Head, info, shape
   * Missing value checks
4. **Data Visualization & Analysis**

   * Team performance
   * Toss impact
   * Match outcome trends

## 📊 Key Questions Answered

✔ Which team has won the most matches?
✔ What are the common toss decisions (bat or field)?
✔ Does winning the toss increase the chances of winning the match?
✔ How do teams usually win matches – by **runs** or **wickets**?
✔ What patterns can be observed using visual analysis?

## 📈 Visualizations Included

* Bar charts for match wins
* Count plots for toss decisions
* Comparative plots for toss winner vs match winner
* Match outcome distribution (runs vs wickets)

All visualizations are created using **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for better readability and insights.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

* Certain teams consistently dominate in match wins
* Fielding after winning the toss is a popular decision
* Winning the toss does **not always guarantee** winning the match
* Matches are more often won by **wickets** than runs
